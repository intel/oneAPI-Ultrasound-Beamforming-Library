# oneAPI-Ultrasound-Beamforming-Library

This project contains ultrasound software beamforming samples, which process ultrasound raw data into images human readable. The project use Intel oneAPI to do computation acceleration with Intel GPU and FPGA. 

![image](Images/workflow-of-beamforming.png)

This project is focusing on the kernel functions of the workflow of ultrasound beamforming process, including Receive Beamforming, Envelope Detection, Log Compression and Scan Conversion. The kernel functions are developed and rewritten based on Supra(https://github.com/IFL-CAMP/supra). We have released a project for migrating origial Supra CUDA code to standard DPC++. For more details, please refer to: https://github.com/intel/supra-on-oneapi.

The purpose of this project is for extracting and rewriting the kernel code for easy utilization and running on Intel GPU and FPGA devices.

## 1. Host Development System

The preferred (and tested) development host platform is PC with Ubuntu 18.04 & 20.04. The PC could have an Intel processor with integrated graphics, a discrete graphics card, or an Intel FPGA. Also you could test the project on Intel Devcloud.

### (1) Run with Devcloud

The Intel DevCloud is a development sandbox to learn about and test programming cross architecture applications with OpenVino, High Level Design (HLD) tools – oneAPI, OpenCL, HLS – and RTL. Devcloud for OneAPI can be used for running and testing this project and you could choose to use Intel FPGA or Intel GPU. Please refer to  https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi to view the details of how to use Devcloud.

### (2) Set up your own development system

If you have your own Intel acceleration devices including Intel CPU with integrated GPU, Intel discrete GPU and Intel FPGA. Run the project on your own development machine is an option. If you do not have any acceleration devices, you could also use Intel CPU as a FPGA emulator to view beamforming results.

This project provides 3 samples to test software beamforming. The first one is for Intel GPU, including integrated GPUs and discrete GPUs. The second sample is using Intel FPGA as data producer to provide data for GPU. The kernel code for GPU is same as the fisrt sample. The third sample is for Intel FPGA. You could choose to run the kernels one by one or make them pipelined to reach better performance.

## 2. oneAPI Ultrasound Beamforming Library Setup

### (1) Get oneAPI Ultrasound Beamforming Library Source Code

Download the source code from GitHub.

    $ git clone https://github.com/intel/ oneAPI-Ultrasound-Beamforming-Library.git

### (2) Initialize oneAPI Environment

After downloading source code, we could start compile it. Initialize one API environment:

    $ source <oneapi root dir>/setvars.sh

Default:

    $ source /opt/intel/inteloneapi/setvars.sh

## 3. Ultrasound Beamforming on Intel GPU

### (1) Build

Enter the project folder.

    $ cd oneAPI-Ultrasound-Beamforming-Library/gpu

Create a directory `build` at the `gpu` directory:

    $ mkdir build

    $ cd build

In this repo, we just call the oneAPI feature to avoid moving data back and forth between host and device as ZMC(Zero memory copy, just an abbreviation to describe the feature in this repo). The detail of the feature could be found in https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-gpu-optimization-guide/top/memory/host-device-memory.html. And the feature is only used for Intel integrated GPU to make no memory copy operation between host and Intel integrated GPU. If you want to test the GPU performance, select whether to use ZMC feature (set to use ZMC by default), run cmake using the command:

    $ cmake .. -DUSE_ZMC=ON/OFF

Then run make using the command:

    $ make -j4

Note: ZMC feature can be only used with Intel integrated GPU. Please switch USE_ZMC = OFF if using Intel discrete graphics card.

### (2) Run the program

Download data to `build` directory.

    $ mkdir data
    $ cd data
    $ wget https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/supra-sample-data/mockData_linearProbe.zip
    $ unzip mockData_linearProbe.zip
    $ cd ..

If just test the GPU performance for easy testing, run the command:

    $ src/easy_app data/linearProbe_IPCAI_128-2.mock data/linearProbe_IPCAI_128-2_0.raw

Note: If you run it on Intel discrete GPU, you need to run `export IGC_EnableDPEmulation=1` before running above command.

### (3) See the result and performance

Comsuming time of each kernel's calculation could be seen in the terminal.
Visual `*.png` results are stored in `res` directory. You could also specify the directory to store result by running the command:

    $ src/easy_app data/linearProbe_IPCAI_128-2.mock data/linearProbe_IPCAI_128-2_0.raw <directory to store results>


## 4. Ultrasound Beamforming on Intel GPU with Intel FPGA as Data Producer

In real application scenarios, FPGA is often used to connect the ultrasound probe to collect data. So we simulated using FPGA as a data producer to provide data for GPU. Of course, a simple application is also provided to test software beamforming on the GPU in Chapter 3. We have tested and valided data producer on Intel® Programmable Acceleration Card with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA.

### (1) Build

Enter the project folder.

    $ cd oneAPI-Ultrasound-Beamforming-Library/gpu

Create a directory `build` at the `gpu` directory:

    $ mkdir build

    $ cd build

In this repo, we just call the oneAPI feature to avoid moving data back and forth between host and device as ZMC(Zero memory copy, just an abbreviation to describe the feature in this repo). The detail of the feature could be found in https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-gpu-optimization-guide/top/memory/host-device-memory.html.

If you want to test the GPU performance, select whether to use ZMC feature (set to use ZMC by default), run cmake using the command:

    $ cmake .. -DUSE_ZMC=ON/OFF

Then run make using the command:

    $ make -j4

If you want to compile FPGA binary or using FPGA emulator to emulate data producer to send data, run `cmake` using the command:

    $ cmake .. -DUSE_ZMC=ON/OFF -DCOMPILE_FPGA=ON

then run make using the command if a new FPGA binary is needed to be compiled:

    $ make fpga -j4  (Use this command only if you have a FPGA hardware card)

If you want to use FPGA emulator, use the command:

    $ make fpga_emu -j4

Note: ZMC feature can be only used with Intel integrated GPU. Please switch USE_ZMC = OFF if using Intel discrete graphics card.

You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board support package is installed on your system. Then run cmake using the command:

    $ cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=<board-support-package>:<board-variant>

Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

Compile for emulation (compiles quickly, targets emulated FPGA device):

    $ make emu

Generate the optimization report:

    $ make report

Compile for FPGA hardware (takes longer to compile, targets FPGA device):

    $ make fpga

### (2) Run the program

Download data to `build` directory.

    $ mkdir data
    $ cd data
    $ wget https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/supra-sample-data/mockData_linearProbe.zip

## 5. Ultrasound Beamforming Pipeline Kernels on Intel FPGA

Ultrasound Beamforming Standalone Kernels on Intel FPGA code has been tested and valided on Intel® Programmable Acceleration Card with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA. Pipelining the kernels can improve the efficiency and performance of the beamforming algorithm on FPGAs. You can refer to the link to learn more about oneAPI dpcpp optimization on Intel FPGA. https://software.intel.com/content/dam/develop/external/us/en/documents/oneapi-dpcpp-fpga-optimization-guide.pdf

### (1) Build

Enter the project folder.

    $ cd oneAPI-Ultrasound-Beamforming-Library/fpga/pipeline

Create a directory `build` at the `pipeline` directory:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build

To compile for the Intel® PAC with Intel Arria® 10 GX FPGA, run cmake using the command. If you want to store the results of each kernel(storing by default and you can choose not to set this option).

    $ cmake .. -DSTORE=ON

Or

    $ cmake .. -DSTORE=OFF

Alternatively, to compile for the Intel® FPGA PAC D5005 (with Intel Stratix® 10 SX), run cmake using the command:

    $ cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=intel_s10sx_pac:pac_s10 -DSTORE=ON/OFF

You can also compile for a custom FPGA platform. Ensure that the board support package is installed on your system. Then run cmake using the command:

    $ cmake .. -DFPGA_BOARD=<board-support-package>:<board-variant> -DSTORE=ON/OFF

You can choose `FAKEDATA` building option `on/off` to valid the performance without DDR bandwith limit. By default, the program will use real raw data to do calculations. If set `-DFAKEDATA=ON`, there will not be DDR bandwidth limit to decrease the throughput of the pipelined program and fake input data will be used. So if using `FAKEDATA`, run `cmake` using the command:

    $ cmake .. -DFAKEDATA=ON -DSTORE=OFF/ON

Compile the design through the generated `Makefile`. The following build targets are provided, matching the recommended development flow:

Compile for emulation (compiles quickly, targets emulated FPGA device):

    $ make emu

Generate the optimization report:

    $ make report

Compile for FPGA hardware (takes longer to compile, targets FPGA device):

    $ make fpga

### (2) Run the program
